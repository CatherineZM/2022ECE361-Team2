The two new features we decided to implement are:
1. Private messaging:
    1. Command: /private <receiver name> <message content>
    2. Feature Explaination:
        A user can send private message to another user regardless of whether theyâ€™re in a session or not. Only the receiver will be able to view it and it will include who is the sender. 
    3. Implementation: 
        We formatted the message packet sent from client to server to have:
        Type: PVT 
        Size: data Size
        Source: sender's username
        Data: <receiver's username>,<message content>

        When the server receives the message packet, it will read the Data field and find out who is the receiver. Then .............. (to be filled)
2. User registration: 
    1. Command: /register <username> <password>
    2. Feature Explaination:
        A client can create a username and password and upon registration, the user will be logged in automatically.
        Note: a client cannot create a new user if the client is already logged in as a user. The client has to log out before creating a new user.
    3. Implementation:
        We formatted the message packet sent from client to server to have:
        Type: REG 
        Size: data Size
        Source: new user's username
        Data: new user's password

        .........(server action to be filled)
